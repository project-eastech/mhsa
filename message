Dear Gordon,

We plan to start our studies prior to the official commencement of Phase 2. To do this effectively, we require access to any documentation or specifications regarding the events, messages, REST API, and other resources from the Consolidated Data Warehouse (CDW). For instance, the schema of the event, types of events (EoD, intraday), examples on using the REST API to retrieve data from CDW, and so on. If the CDW team has this information available, could you please assist us in obtaining it? Access to this information would greatly enhance our understanding and planning. Thank you in advance for your help.

Additionally, to gain a better understanding of the events and REST API of CDW, we would appreciate your assistance in coordinating with the infrastructure team to set up the following resources, which will enable us to start building prototypes and significantly contribute to our progress. Please refer to the attached Excel worksheet for the recommended configuration details.
-	Event Hub for CDW
-	Spark Pool for Synapse

Once the infrastructure resources are ready, could you also help us arrange the following?
1.	Coordinate with the CDW team to configure sending events to the Event Hub from CDW.
2.	Provide the authentication details for using the CDW REST API with Python.

Thank you for your support.

Regards,  
Ellis
